    <h3>The Champion Month</h3>

    <p>The Champion Month is a 30 day challenge where participants are urged to set themselves goals, eating naturally and experience fuller lifestyle. The goals can be small and big and can be everything from visiting your grandparents more often to running a marathon. The ultimate goal is to become the champion of your own life. The premise is to give everyone a chance to synchronously set goals and develop habits that would otherwise be impossible, were it not for your peers mental support. </p>

    <p>The Champion Month is an Icelandic health and lifestyle movement co-founded by Magnus Berg Magnusson and Thorsteinn Kari Jonsson in 2010. In 2011 Jokull Solberg Audunsson joined the Champion Month team and is one of the partners today. In the beginning the Champion Month was only a two men movement but as the word spread out through Social Media more people got on board. Throughout the years the concept has gained widespread critical and commercial success in Iceland and in 2013 over 9.000 people, or nearly 3% of the Icelandic population, signed up for the Champion Month. The Champion Month was even discussed at the Icelandic Parliament where members were urged to take Champion Month participants as an exemplary. All major media outlets in Iceland, including the National Broadcasting Service of Iceland, have followed the Champion Month and its participants closely throughout the years. The Champion Month has also become something like a phenomenon on Social Media where the hashtag #meistaram has been become well known on medias such as Instagram and Twitter.</p>
